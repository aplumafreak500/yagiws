	* Rename "Pouring Heartstrings" (Sigewinne's bow) to "Silvershower Heartstrings"
	* Initial support for 4.8 and 5.0
	* Convert Chronicled Wish pool data to a function, since because it hasn't ran for a while, it doesn't make sense to continue using an lut containing just one entry and a bunch of `NULL`s

	* Implement Capturing Radiance
		* The initial implementation in this program simply adds an extra 10% chance to get the rate-up item when losing the initial 50/50 for a 5-star. This is based on speculation on how the system will likely work in the official implementaion. Do note that this program's implementation is subject to change in later versions if/when more information becomes available.
